# SZScraper

This one is a small web scraper script I wrote in 2020, which scraped all newspaper articles from a specific rubric of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung (SZ).
It is written in Python and uses standard libraries for web scraping like e.g. BeautifulSoap.

## How does it work?

You start it simply with python sz_scraper.py.
It will then scrape all articles from the page (in the code it's the page with the category "Politik") and save them to a json.


It probably doesn't work any more because HTML tags change with time and I haven't tested it any more since then. But feel free to let it inspire you.
