# SZScraper

**SZScraper** is a web scraping script I developed in 2020 to extract newspaper articles from a specific section of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) website. This Python script utilizes standard web scraping libraries, including Beautiful Soup, to fetch articles from the targeted web page.

## How Does It Work?

Running **SZScraper** is straightforward. Simply execute the script by running `python sz_scraper.py` in your terminal or command prompt. The script is configured to scrape all articles from a specific web page (in the code, it targets the "Politik" category) and save them to a JSON file.

Please note that this script may no longer work as expected, as web page structures and HTML tags can change over time. I have not actively maintained or tested it since 2020. However, you are welcome to use it as a source of inspiration for your own web scraping projects.

Feel free to explore and modify the script to suit your needs, adapting it to work with the current structure of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung website or other websites you wish to scrape. Happy scraping!
